The EngiMath Hub: Portfolio Project Plan1. Vision and GoalGoal: To create a full-scale, responsive web application that serves as a personalized platform for Engineering Mathematics students and instructors to practice problems, track mastery, and manage educational content.Portfolio Focus: Demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development (frontend, backend simulation logic, and database management), user authentication/authorization, and complex data visualization (progress tracking).Target Audience: Undergraduate students in engineering/STEM fields and their instructors.2. Core Features (MVP)A. User Authentication and Roles (Crucial for Tracking)Secure Authentication: Standard sign-up/login.Role-Based Access:Student Role: Access to problem sets, tracking, and practice mode.Teacher/Admin Role: Ability to create, edit, and categorize problem sets; view aggregate student progress reports.B. Dynamic Problem Solving and ContentTopic Organization: Problems categorized by standard Engineering Mathematics topics (e.g., Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Vector Calculus, Numerical Methods).Problem View: Each problem displays the question, necessary constants, and uses KaTeX or MathJax for beautiful, clear mathematical rendering.Solution Input: A text area for students to input their final answer. Initially, use simple text input and focus on multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank numerical answers for easy grading.Hint System: Offer tiered hints (e.g., "Hint 1: Check the formula," "Hint 2: Simplify the boundary conditions").C. Progress and Tracking (The Portfolio Differentiator)Personal Dashboard: Students see an overview of their progress:Mastery Score: A percentage showing problems solved correctly vs. attempted per topic.Activity Log: List of recently attempted problems and their results (Correct/Incorrect).Topic Breakdown: A list of all topics with a visual indicator (e.g., a color-coded bar chart) showing mastery level for each.Teacher Reports (Admin View): Overview of class performance on specific problem sets and identification of "trouble topics."3. Technology Stack RecommendationComponentTechnologyReasoningFrontend (UI)React (with TypeScript)Industry standard, robust component model, excellent for complex single-page applications.StylingTailwind CSSHighly desirable skill; ensures rapid, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing design.Math RenderingKaTeX / MathJaxEssential for clear, high-quality rendering of mathematical formulas in the browser.State/DatabaseFirebase (Firestore)Easy setup, real-time updates for tracking, built-in Authentication, and free hosting (Firebase Hosting) for deployment.Logic (Future)(Client-side JS / Simple Serverless Functions)Initial problem logic can be client-side. For advanced symbolic math (future scope), you'd integrate with a third-party API or a Python backend.4. Proposed Data Structure (Firestore Collections)The efficiency of your application relies heavily on how data is structured.A. users CollectionDocument ID: auth.uidFields: email, role (student or teacher), name.B. topics CollectionDocument ID: Auto-generated (topicId)Fields: name (Linear Algebra), description, parentArea (Maths), difficulty.C. problems CollectionDocument ID: Auto-generated (problemId)Fields:topicId: Reference to the topics collection.questionText: (The main prompt, potentially in LaTeX format).solutionKey: (The correct numerical/text answer).hints: (An array of strings for tiered hints).createdBy: (Reference to the teacher's userId).D. progress Collection (Student Tracking)Document ID: Combination of userId and problemId (e.g., userA_problem123)Fields:userId: Reference to the user.problemId: Reference to the problem.attempts: Number of times attempted (integer).lastAttemptResult: Boolean (True/False).mastered: Boolean (True if solved correctly 3+ times, for example).lastAttemptedAt: Timestamp.5. Future Enhancements (Beyond MVP)Once the core tracking system is robust, these features will make the project even more impressive:Python Backend Integration: Use Python (Flask/Django) to run symbolic computation libraries (like SymPy) to validate complex algebraic answers, moving beyond simple numerical checks.Gamification: Implement streaks, badges, or a leader board to encourage continuous practice.Interactive Visualizations: For topics like Vector Calculus or Differential Equations, integrate libraries like D3.js or three.js to provide simple interactive 2D/3D visualizations of solutions.
