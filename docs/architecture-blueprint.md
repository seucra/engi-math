Absolutely — you're building a **hybrid desktop application** with **C++ doing the heavy lifting** and **Rust providing safety and control**. That’s a powerful but complex architecture.

Here are the **critical areas** to keep in mind — grouped by **theme**, not just language.

---

## 🧠 ARCHITECTURE: Clean Boundaries Are Everything

### 1. **Strict Ownership Model**

* **Rust owns memory** → C++ *borrows* temporarily.
* Never let C++ keep long-lived references unless **you explicitly manage lifetimes**.
* Enforce that no FFI pointer outlives its scope.

✅ *Think: Rust is the landlord, C++ is a temporary tenant.*

---

### 2. **Well-Defined Module Responsibilities**

Split your app into **clear layers**, for example:

```txt
UI (Qt / C++)
↑
Rust API (safe FFI layer)
↑
Rust Core Logic (validation, error handling)
↑
C++ Compute (math-heavy operations)
```

* Don’t mix concerns: math logic in C++ should not log to UI, for instance.
* Make Rust the **gatekeeper** for external I/O and final output.

---

### 3. **FFI Interface Stability**

* Keep FFI functions small, pure, and flat.
* Avoid passing complex C++ classes or Rust structs directly — use:

  * `*mut T`
  * Slices (`*mut T + length`)
  * Simple `struct`s with plain fields (C-style layout)
* Mark any shared data with `#[repr(C)]` on Rust side to ensure layout compatibility.

---

## 🔒 SECURITY & STABILITY

### 4. **Safe FFI Isolation**

* Put all `unsafe` code in a **single Rust module**, like `ffi.rs`.
* Wrap every unsafe function with a safe public version.
* Document exactly what C++ is allowed to do with the pointers/data.

✅ *If it crashes or leaks, you’ll know exactly where to look.*

---

### 5. **Crash Resistance**

* C++ must not throw exceptions across FFI — it will cause UB.

  * Catch in C++, return error code, or call back into Rust with result.
* Rust uses `Result<T, E>` — map C++ errors to this.

---

### 6. **Threading Discipline**

If your app is multithreaded:

* Use **Rust threads** and keep C++ work inside isolated blocks.
* Don’t let shared mutable state cross between Rust and C++ threads.
* Use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` in Rust; avoid passing raw shared pointers across FFI.

---

## 🧪 TESTING & DEBUGGING

### 7. **Integration Tests Matter**

* Test every FFI function with:

  * Invalid input
  * Null pointers
  * Empty arrays
  * Edge cases (e.g., 1x1 matrix)
* Use Rust's test framework to simulate usage.

✅ *Rust's testability can save you hours of C++ debugging.*

---

### 8. **Memory Tools**

Use tools like:

* **Valgrind** or **AddressSanitizer** on C++ to catch invalid memory access.
* **Miri** on Rust (for unsafe code analysis).
* `cargo-geiger` to detect use of `unsafe` in dependencies.

---

## 🔧 DEVOPS & TOOLCHAIN

### 9. **Cross-Language Build System**

Use a build system that can coordinate C++ and Rust:

* `CMake` + `Cargo` (can be combined)
* Or `cargo-c` / `cxx` to build C++ libs and link into Rust

Automate:

* Shared header generation
* Cross-platform builds
* Dependency tracking (vcpkg, conan for C++, cargo for Rust)

---

### 10. **Binary Packaging**

Eventually, you’ll need to:

* **Bundle your Rust + C++ binary** into a single desktop app
* Possibly use:

  * `Qt Installer Framework` (for Qt apps)
  * `cargo-bundle`
  * `AppImage` / `MSIX` / `.app` bundle

Don’t forget to include:

* Required `.so`/`.dll` files
* Fonts, icons, config files
* Readme + license

---

## 🔁 MAINTAINABILITY

### 11. **Language Boundary Documentation**

Document in your codebase:

* What each side (C++/Rust) is allowed to do
* Who owns memory, who can free
* How errors propagate
* Which functions are thread-safe

Use diagrams if needed — this helps future contributors avoid breaking everything.

---

### 12. **Security-First Defaults**

* Sanitize inputs (from UI or file)
* Validate dimensions of all data passed to C++
* Avoid any hardcoded paths, shell commands, or environment assumptions
* Use safe random number generation if needed (Rust's `rand`, not C rand)

| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Prefer `cxx` over raw FFI                      | Adds type safety and ergonomic syntax                  |
| Benchmark both sides                           | Sometimes Rust will outperform C++ even on heavy tasks |
| Use `#[no_mangle]` and `extern "C"` properly   | Prevent symbol name mangling                           |
| Create a `lib.cpp` and `lib.rs` boundary layer | Helps keep things clean                                |
| Avoid globals in C++                           | Can break thread safety and FFI assumptions            |

## 🚧 Example FFI Rule of Thumb

> “Every pointer that crosses the boundary must have:
>
> * A valid size
> * Clear ownership
> * Documented lifetime
> * Zero surprises on both sides.”

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

You're planning a **hybrid engineering desktop app**, which will likely run for years and be used by students, researchers, or professionals. That means:

* Stability and safety matter more than bleeding-edge features.
* The way you **structure and document your stack now** will define how far it can scale later.

You're already thinking like a systems architect — and combining C++ and Rust like this, if done cleanly, gives you **power, speed, and security** in a way few stacks can match.
